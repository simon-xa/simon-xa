- 👋 Hi, I’m Simon Li @simon-xa, from China.
- 👀 I’m a C++ programmer, almost for 30 years. Now I’m retired. I’m good at pure mathematics, analysis and algebra, for example. Geometry is some hard to me, especially algebraic geometry.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning something, some projects, with math and C++.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some projects with math and C++.
- 📫 How to reach me: simonli.xa@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: ... wtf? no idea...
- ⚡ Fun fact: ... fun fact? I'm not funny, but strong. In other words, I'm a cool asshole.
